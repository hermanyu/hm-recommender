# Problem Statement

The rise of the internet over the last 20 years has revolutionized how human society conducts business on a fundamental level. As brick-and-mortar stores give way to e-commerce and online retail, there has been a torrent of data from user iteractions and user transactions. The fundamental question that all businesses must answer is this: how do we harness our companies enormous data stream to provide a more customized user experience and drive revenue growth?

Recommender Systems sit at the crossroads of marketing/SEO, front-end development, back-end data management, UI/UX, and data science/machine learning theory. The ultimate goal of any recommender system is to accurately determine what item a user is "most likely to buy next" and show the user that particular item. A good recommender system actively translates into revenue growth for online retailers and thus are of incredible interest to any business with an online prescence.

The purpose of this project extract product features from 2 years worth of online transactional data from the clothing retailer H&M. We then use these extracted features to make recommendations to users.
