# Problem Statement

Recommender Systems sit at the crossroads of marketing/SEO, front-end development, back-end data management, UI/UX, and data science/machine learning theory. In this project, we shall tackle the problem of generating user recommendations from the perspective of Search Engine querying. Concretely, this project explores and implements the following 5 ideas:
1. Popularity based recommendations. For example: Netflix's Top 10 Today.
2. Co-occurrence based recommendations. For example: Amazon's "Users who bought this also bought..."
3. Text-based feature querying. For example: Google/Amazon search bar.
4. Image-based feature querying. For example: Google Image Search.

We implement each of these ideas via a streamlit application which can be <a href='https://github.com/hermanyu/hm-recommender-app'> found here </a>. Since recommender systems are primarily client-facing, we attempt to demonstrate how each of these ideas can be deployed on a barebones webpage mimicing an e-commerce setting.
